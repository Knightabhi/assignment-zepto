# Getting Started with this project

- I have 2 accounts on a single device so pushed a commit using second one by mistake please ignore 2 contributor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

**Note:** I am using Yarn but you can use Npm as well 

### `yarn install`

This will install node modules 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Specifications
- When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
- As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
- Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
- Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
- Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

## Bonus Task
- Clean code.
- TypeScript.
- When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted, and on pressing backspace again, it should get deleted.

**Note:** We have taken care of all the specified points in the project, including implementing the specified features and meeting the bonus task requirements. The code is written in React using Create React App, and TypeScript has been used for improved type safety and readability.
